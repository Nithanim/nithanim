Hello!

I am a Java developer, both at work and at home.
You will find me working not only on very detailed problems, like fixing a problem with native compilation, but also broader projects, like building libraries to be used by other developers.

I love open source and permissive licenses.
Without them, most of my work would not exist.
Therefore, most of my stuff is free too!
Be sure to borrow stuff if you need it!

## Interests
As already mentioned in the introduction, I like Java (a lot)!
Generally I dig into everything I can find about it.
This is not restricted to language features, but also the JVM itself (and others, GraalVM) and the ecosystem as a whole (all the libraries!).
