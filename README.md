Hello!

I am a Java developer, both at work and at home.
You will find me working not only on very detailed problems, like fixing a problem with native compilation, but also broader projects, like building libraries to be used by other developers.

I love open source and permissive licenses.
Without them, most of my work would not exist.
Therefore, most of my stuff is free too!
Be sure to borrow stuff if you need it!



## Interests


### Java
As already mentioned in the introduction, I like Java (a lot)!
Generally I dig into everything I can find about it.
This is not restricted to language features, but also the JVM itself (and others, GraalVM) and the ecosystem as a whole (all the libraries!).

### C/Native
Sometimes you want to do some low-level stuff, requiring talking to the OS itself.
This is only possible if you can read and write C and have some knowledge about the things running behind the scenes.

Sadly, I have not gotten into C++ yet. But I would like to dive into rust at some point!


### File formats
I like file formats. They are extremely precise and picky, they are weird, they look completely different every time.
I have worked on reverse-engineering a couple and it has been a challenge every time! Fun but challenging. 

### Serverless
My employer pushed to the cloud (AWS specifically) which meant to adapt.
The environment is completely different and removes a lot of headache for basic functionality.
It is extremely exciting to just use big building blocks and design large systems while only programming basic functions!

No need to waste time on something that already "just works"!


### Security
Nowadays, it is essential to build systems where security is not just an afterhought.
My goal is to always remind myself on "how this could be abused" when designing systems or writing code.
It is helpful to have [brnhrd](https://github.com/brnhrd/) for insights about stupid stuff to avoid.
